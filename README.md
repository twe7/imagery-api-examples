# Tailwind API Examples

A set of examples that demonstrate how to work with the Tailwind API.

Examples:
- [Listing images](./list-images.py)
- [Purchasing an image](./purchase-image.py)
- [Download image](./download-image.py)

All examples are interactive and can be run via Python. Before you can integrate with the API and run the examples, you need to obtain an API key. 

The examples use the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library to perform HTTP requests, so you'll
need to install it locally:
```
pip3 install requests --user
``` 

To run an example, just use the Python CLI:
```
python3 list-images.py
```

> Don't forget to set the correct API key when running the example.
